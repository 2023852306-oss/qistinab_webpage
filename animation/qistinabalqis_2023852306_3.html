	Influenza infections are generally most common from June to September. There is often more than one strain of influenza in the community at this time.Flu season is also the time of year when you are more likely to stay indoors and be in close contact with other people. This makes it easier for the virus to pass between people.You should get your annual flu vaccine anytime from April onwards. Each year the vaccine is made to match the most common strains of flu. </p>
